# Projects vs Classic

> >

There's two versions of GitHub Projects. All new projects are created with the new GitHub Projects, but you may run into an instance where a repo is still using the classic projects experience. Let's talk about the differences.

# Classic Projects

- New Projects
- Board Experience
- Repo/Org Level
- Migrating


> >

You can't create new classic projects, you can only create a new classic project for an organization that has at least one classic project.

Classic projects are made up of issues, pull requests, and notes that are similar to the way boards work in the regular version of projects.

With classic projects, you could add a project at a repo level, but with new projects, your projects are created at the organization level and be attached to your repos. This makes a lot more sense, because it makes all the projects much easier to find instead of having to dig around individual repos.

You can migrate a project from classic to the new experience. When you find a repo that was created in classic mode, it will say classic in parenthesis and when you open up that project you'll see a way to migrate to the new projects right at the top.
