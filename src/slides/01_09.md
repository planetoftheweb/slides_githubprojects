# Saved Replies
By the way, when someone responds to an issue, you can add an automated reply that you've set up.

# Setting up a Saved Reply
- To get to save reply, click on your profile photo and choose `settings`
- Look for the `code, planning and automation` section and click on `saved replies`.
- You can add a title and a description using the markdown editor or by writing regular markdown code. You can even attach files like graphics or video into the message box.
- Notice there's a preview tab here

# Editing
Once you've created a saved reply, you can see them in this same place under saved replies, so under saved replies, you'll see a list of saved replies, where you can edit or delete previous saved replies

# Using A Saved Reply
To use these, you can go to any repo and either on an issue or pull request, you can add a saved reply you've previously set up.

Once you're in an issue or pull request, you can go to the GitHub editor and choose the reply arrow. You'll see a list of saved replies. 

You can filter the list by typing something in here once you have a lot of saved replies!

Pick the one you want to use. You can, of course edit these further in the editor.

When you're in the editor, by the way, you can call up the saved replies with your keyboard. 
`Ctrl+.` and then `Ctrl+[saved reply number]`
